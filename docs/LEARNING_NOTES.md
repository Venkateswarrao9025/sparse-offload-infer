# Learning notes

Running log for this project -- for me, not recruiters. Check off topics as
they're internalized well enough to explain at a whiteboard (PROJECT_SPEC.md
sec 9). Add a dated paragraph per milestone under "Milestone log" explaining
what clicked and what didn't.

## Milestone log

### M0 -- Harness and baseline (done)

2026-09-14 -- 2026-09-15. Repo scaffolded locally (no NVIDIA GPU on the dev
machine -- see docs/DESIGN.md), pushed to GitHub, driven from a Colab T4
session via the `colab-mcp` MCP bridge (Claude Code editing/running notebook
cells directly rather than a human clicking through them).

What actually happened, worth remembering:
- `uvx git+https://...` for an MCP server is slow on its very first
  invocation (cloning + resolving ~100 deps) and blew through Claude Code's
  30s MCP connection timeout on the first try. Once cached locally, it
  connects in ~8s. If a similar MCP server ever times out on first connect,
  retry rather than assume it's broken.
- The Colab browser bridge attaches to a specific tab at connect time, not
  dynamically to "whatever tab is focused now" -- if cell reads look wrong
  (e.g. an unexpectedly blank notebook), close other Colab tabs and
  re-open the connection.
- transformers 5.x removed the `load_in_8bit=True` shorthand kwarg;
  needs `quantization_config=BitsAndBytesConfig(load_in_8bit=True)` now.
  Also: don't let one baseline variant's failure (missing bitsandbytes)
  crash the script before `write_csv` runs -- wrap each variant so partial
  results survive.
- `add_one` built and passed on the first real compile against `sm_75` on
  an actual T4 -- the `setup.py`/`common.cuh` arch-gating scaffolding from
  the GPU-less local session translated correctly to real hardware.
- Colab's T4 instance allowed `nvidia-smi -lgc` clock locking this session
  (not guaranteed -- the notebook falls back gracefully if it's ever
  refused).

Results: see docs/RESULTS.md and `reports/m0_pcie_bandwidth.csv` /
`reports/m0_baseline.csv`. Next: M1 (CUDA fundamentals -- vector add,
coalescing sweep, reduction variants, transpose with/without padding).
